# About Me

I am graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. I am doing my thesis in Monica Mugnier's lab researching how *T. brucei* parasites avoid the immune system. Specifically, I use RNA-Seq to investigate antigenic variation in different tissue spaces over the course of an infection. I use R and python to analyze data sets and visualize results.

I created this blog to help myself learn R and python and how to apply these tools to a data set. I also wanted to keep a log of posts explaining things for my own future reference because I contstantly forget the specifics of functions I use. My end goal is to have a career in data science and I thought this could be a good reference place for my work.

# About this site 

This site was created using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), which uses R to create a static site powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I used the [Hugo Future Imperfect](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect) theme as the backbone of this site. I create my blog posts using R markdown and publicly available data sets.
