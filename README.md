# The Data Log
A data science blog by Alex Beaver. Found here: https://thedatalog.netlify.app/. 

The R markdown files used to create the blog posts can be found [here](content/blog). 

I used the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) as a guide for creating this website and I used the [Hugo Future Imperfect](https://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/) theme.
