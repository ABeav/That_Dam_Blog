      <description>For my first ever blog post, I thought I would start off with a simple question using a simple dataset. When I turned 16, I did what every 16 year-old in America does and immediately got behind the wheel of a car.

For the record, I still have nightmares about trying to start my old car on a steep hill.</description>
